# WARRIOR'S HONOR
Codewars is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata.

If you are a Codewars warrior, you must be familiar with the different rewards earned through completing code challenges to move to other Katas (levels). When starting out, a warrior may have a difficult time understanding the points system and charting their progress. This website provides a snapshot of your progress and calculates what actions are necessary to reach the next level.

# My CodeWar Profile

[](https://www.codewars.com/users/DavidNey/badges/large)

I Love doing code challenges for fun! I try to do at least 1 or 2 code challenges every morning while having coffee. Most of the challenges I do are from [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/). When I started codewars out, I did not know how the ranking system and Honor points work. I found out that they have an API with all their data so I made this website to have a snapshot of my friends and my progress. This was for me to have a better idea of what to do to compete for a better position in our clan ranking.
